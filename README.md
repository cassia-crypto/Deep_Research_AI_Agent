AI Agent-Based Deep Research System
This repository contains the implementation of an AI agent-based Deep Research System that utilizes Tavily for online information gathering. The system features a dual-agent architecture: one agent for research and data collection, and another agent for drafting the final answer. It is designed using the LangGraph and LangChain frameworks to organize and manage the gathered data.

Project Overview:-
The AI Agent-Based Deep Research System is designed to efficiently gather information from online sources using Tavily and organize it into structured responses. The system is split into two agents:
Research Agent: This agent queries Tavily to collect information on a given topic.
Draft Agent: This agent takes the gathered research content and drafts a comprehensive final answer.
The system uses LangGraph to model the flow of data and control the interaction between these agents, and LangChain to handle the logic of processing and delivering results.


System Design:-
The system is built around the following components:

Research Agent:
Uses Tavily to search the web for information based on user queries.
Gathers a list of relevant results (titles and URLs) from the Tavily API.

Draft Agent:
Takes the gathered research content and formats it into a coherent draft.
The draft provides the user with a comprehensive answer to their query.

LangGraph:
Manages the state and the transitions between the two agents (Research and Draft).
Coordinates the flow of information from the search phase to the draft phase.

LangChain:
Facilitates communication between different agents and ensures that information is processed efficiently.


Technologies Used:-
Tavily: A web scraping API to gather information from the web.
LangGraph: A framework for building state-driven workflows, managing agent interaction.
LangChain: A library for handling workflows and chaining together agents in a structured manner.
Python: The programming language used to implement the entire system.


Installation:-
To run this system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-research-ai-agent.git
cd deep-research-ai-agent
2. Install the dependencies:
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the necessary Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up your Tavily API key:
Make sure to create an account with Tavily and get your API key. Set your API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copy
Edit
export TAVILY_API_KEY='your-tavily-api-key'  # For macOS/Linux
set TAVILY_API_KEY='your-tavily-api-key'     # For Windows
4. Run the system:
Once everything is set up, you can run the system using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python agent.py


Usage Instructions:-
After running the system, you will be prompted to enter a research query.
The Research Agent will gather information based on your query.
The Draft Agent will then organize the research into a final answer.
The final result will be printed to the console.


How It Works:-
User Input: The user enters a query for which they want information.
Research Phase: The Research Agent searches for relevant content using Tavilyâ€™s API.
Drafting Phase: The Draft Agent processes the gathered content and formats it into a readable answer.
Result: The system presents the final answer to the user.


Future Improvements:-
Enhanced Error Handling: Improve error handling for edge cases such as no results returned from Tavily.
More Agents: Add additional agents for refining or verifying the research content.
Better User Interface: Create a GUI for more user-friendly interactions.
More Data Sources: Integrate additional sources of information for more robust answers.
Caching Results: Cache previous queries to speed up the research process for repeated queries.
